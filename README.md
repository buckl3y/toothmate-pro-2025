## Introduction

### Description

ToothMate is dedicated to enhancing oral healthcare and making it more accessible for everyone. Driven by a vision to educate people about oral health and ensure that care is available for future generations, our current focus is on ToothMate Professionalâ€”a tool designed to assist dental professionals in their daily work. This project builds on the efforts of previous teams and aims to refine existing features for better performance.

### Project Summary and Purpose

The goal of ToothMate Professional is to streamline the workflow of dental professionals by improving the dental charting interface and adding features like deciduous dental charting. We're committed to creating a user-friendly interface that aligns with modern standards, making the software both practical and functional.

This project serves as a demonstration of ToothMate Professional's capabilities to attract interest from potential investors. By focusing on key areas such as dental charting, user interface improvements, and voice transcription, we aim to reduce the time dentists spend on paperwork, allowing them to focus more on patient care. Ultimately, we aim to deliver a working prototype that meets current needs and supports better care for future generations.

## Website Hosting

On Render, create a **Web Service** and a **Static Site** service. The Static Site will serve as hosting for the frontend (client), and the Web Service will serve as hosting for the backend (server).

![Render Services](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/180d357a-e472-4df7-aa87-1d34f3768e65)

In your Web Service, navigate to the **Environment** tab, and add a new environment variable:

- **Key:** `PORT`
- **Value:** `5000`

![Web Service Environment Variable](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d106e596-269b-4f02-a3ee-53955d6b8a61)

In your Static Site, navigate to the **Environment** tab, and add a new environment variable:

- **Key:** `VITE_SERVER_URL`
- **Value:** (The URL of your Web Service)

![Static Site Environment Variable](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2121a5b-963f-4a44-8f3d-709dfdbd657a)

---

## Workflow

1. **After cloning the repo, create a new branch:**
```
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```


2. **To stage and commit changes:**
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
git push
```

3. **If you come back after some time, update your repo to the latest version from GitHub before working on development:**
```
git pull
```

## Usage

### Homepage

After running the server, this will be your homepage:

![Homepage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2502498e-78c6-4e6e-bb05-45363ef4b274)

You can toggle between the Dentist view and Administration view by clicking the image on the navbar:

![Toggle Views](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1376eee2-f27e-451c-b8df-c87a6364a397)

You can search for the NHI number in the search bar. This is case-insensitive (e.g., `nH123`), and can be either the digits of the NHI number (e.g., `123`), or the full NHI number itself (e.g., `NH123`). This will give you the patient information.

![Search NHI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b30caa6-898c-4fe4-b6f6-9fb0b74df7db)

In the Dentist view, in the search bar, search for the patient's name or NHI number:

![Dentist View Search](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d16a09a3-13e0-44db-a14f-25233b65c53c)

## Migration to Other Hosting Services

While the project is currently hosted on Render, it can be easily migrated to other popular hosting services like Vercel or Netlify. Here's a brief guide on how to do this:

---

### Migrating to Vercel

1. Sign up for a Vercel account: Go to Vercel's website and create an account if you don't have one.
  
2. Install Vercel CLI: Install the Vercel Command Line Interface by running:
```
npm i -g vercel
```
3. Deploy the frontend
  - Navigate to the `2024-client` directory
  - Run `vercel` and follow the prompts
  - Set the build command to `npm run build`
  - Set the output directory to `dist`

4. Deploy the backend:
  - Navigate to the `2024-server` directory
  - Create a `vercel.json` file with the following content:
```
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "server.js"
    }
  ]
}
```
  - Run vercel and follow the prompts
  - 
5. Set environment variables: In the Vercel dashboard, set the necessary environment variables for both the frontend and backend projects.

---

### Migrating to Netlify
1. Sign up for a Netlify account: Go to Netlify's website and create an account if you don't have one.
  
2. Deploy the frontend:
  - In the Netlify dashboard, click "New site from Git"
  - Connect to your GitHub repository
  - Set the build command to `npm run build`
  - Set the publish directory to `dist`

3. Deploy the backend:
  - Create a `netlify.toml` file in the root of your project with the following content:
```
[build]
  command = "cd 2024-server && npm install"
  functions = "2024-server/functions"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200
```
- Create a `functions` directory in the `2024-server` folder
  - Move your `server.js` file to the `functions` directory and rename it to `api.js`
  - Modify `api.js` to export your Express app as a Netlify function
 
4. Set environment variables: In the Netlify dashboard, set the necessary environment variables for both the frontend and backend projects.

Remember to update your frontend code to use the new backend URL after migration. Also, ensure that all dependencies are properly listed in your `package.json` files for both frontend and backend.
